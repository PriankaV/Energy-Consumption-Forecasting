# **Energy Consumption Forecasting** 🌍⚡
This project aims to predict future energy consumption based on historical energy usage data. The goal is to analyze, preprocess, and model energy consumption data using machine learning techniques to forecast future usage trends.

## Project Overview 📊
This repository includes data from various sources, such as hourly energy consumption data, household electric power consumption, and related project files. The data will be used to train models for energy consumption forecasting.

### Data Sources 📁:
- **Hourly Energy Consumption Dataset**: A collection of hourly energy consumption data from multiple utilities across different regions.
- **Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset**: Contains data on power consumption of households over time.
- **Additional Datasets**: Various datasets related to energy consumption, power generation, and demand.

### Technologies Used 💻:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Git LFS (for large file storage)

## File Structure 📂
- **`Main.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- **`Project Proposal.pdf`**: Project proposal document outlining the objectives and approach.
- **`Hourly Energy Consumption/`**: Folder containing various hourly energy consumption CSV files.
- **`Household Electric Power Consumption/`**: Folder containing the `household_power_consumption.txt` file.
- **`.gitattributes`**: Git LFS configuration file to track large files such as `household_power_consumption.txt`.
