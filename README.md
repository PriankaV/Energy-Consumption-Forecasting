# **Energy Consumption Forecasting** üåç‚ö°
This project aims to predict future energy consumption based on historical energy usage data. The goal is to analyze, preprocess, and model energy consumption data using machine learning techniques to forecast future usage trends.

## Project Overview üìä
This repository includes data from various sources, such as hourly energy consumption data, household electric power consumption, and related project files. The data will be used to train models for energy consumption forecasting.

### Data Sources üìÅ:
- **Hourly Energy Consumption Dataset**: A collection of hourly energy consumption data from multiple utilities across different regions.

### Technologies Used üíª:
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Git LFS (for large file storage)

## File Structure üìÇ
- **`Main.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- **`Project Proposal.pdf`**: Project proposal document outlining the objectives and approach.
- **`Hourly Energy Consumption/`**: Folder containing various hourly energy consumption CSV files.
- **`Household Electric Power Consumption/`**: Folder containing the `household_power_consumption.txt` file.
- **`.gitattributes`**: Git LFS configuration file to track large files such as `household_power_consumption.txt`.

## Results üìä
The energy consumption forecasting model successfully predicted future energy usage trends with high accuracy. By utilizing machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest and Decision Trees, the model was able to identify significant patterns in energy consumption over time. Key performance metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) were evaluated to assess the model's performance. These results indicate that the developed model can be effectively used to forecast future energy consumption and help optimize energy resource management.
